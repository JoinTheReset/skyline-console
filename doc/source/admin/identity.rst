Manage projects, users and roles (Identity tab)
================================================

OpenStack administrators can create projects, create accounts for new users
and create roles.

A project is the base unit of resource ownership. Resources are owned by
a specific project. A project is owned by a specific domain.A role is a
personality that a user assumes to perform a specific set of operations.
A role includes a set of rights and privileges. A user is an individual
consumer that is owned by a domain. A role explicitly associates a user
with projects or domains. A user with no assigned roles has no access
to OpenStack resources.

OpenStack Identity Service is the module in the OpenStack framework that
manages the authentication, service rules and service token functions.
